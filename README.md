This project is set out to teach the basics of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It requires students to create a landing page for a fictional company, including a header, a body, and a footer, as well as some basic styling. Students are also encouraged to add additional features to their landing page, such as a contact form or a slideshow.
